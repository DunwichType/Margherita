# Margherita Type Family Notes

Margherita is a typeface developed by James Puckett of Dunwich Type Founders.

The static TrueType fonts are hinted with TTF Autohint. The variable font is manually hinted.

This is my first variable font project. It may contain bugs that I haven’t found because I haven’t developed a complete testing routine. Please report problems. The variable font will not work in Adobe Indesign. This is an issue with Indesign, not the font, and I cannot fix it.

Manually hinted TrueType fonts are now included. File size is significantly smaller than autohinted fonts and rendering is just as good IMHO. Hinting is done using Glyphs. Hinted is expected to work down to 14px. Don’t expect a display type to work any smaller than that. WOFF2 fonts use manual hinting. Manual hinting is only for Directwrite. For older versions of Windows use the autohinted fonts.

The variable font is manually hinted because it has to be. On Windows there are some problems with this—rendering of diacritical marks is a mess, they up and down in different weights and sizes.  So consider the variable font experimental. Don’t use it anywhere that Windows users matter.

Margherita was developed and compiled using Glyphs 2.
