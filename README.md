# Margherita Type Family Notes

Margherita is a typeface developed by James Puckett of Dunwich Type Founders.

The static TrueType fonts are hinted with TTF Autohint. The variable font is manually hinted.

This is my first variable font project. It may contain bugs that I haven’t found because I haven’t developed a complete testing routine. Please report problems. The variable font will not work in Adobe Indesign. This is an issue with Indesign, not the font, and I cannot fix it.

Margherita was developed and compiled using Glyphs 2.
